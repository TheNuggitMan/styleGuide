Style Guide mock-up
=======

Basic mock-up site that mimics a typical style guide used by the developers for keeping content consistent throughout a website project. 

A good test of positioning knowledge and using the:

``` 
box-sizing: border-box 
```

model rather than the:

``` 
content-box 
```

model. 

Happy with my clean code, and repsonsiveness of the site.
