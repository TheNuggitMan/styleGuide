Style Guide mock-up
=======

Basic mock-up site that mimics a typical style guide used by the developers for keeping content consistent throughout a website project. 

A good test of positioning knowledge and in using the box model:

``` 
box-sizing: border-box 
```

Rather than the content box model:

``` 
box-sizing: content-box 
```


Happy with my clean code, and repsonsiveness of the site.
